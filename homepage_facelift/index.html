            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
            <p>All of our Pet Stylist of Puppy Bubbles provides all breed dog grooming.</p>
            <p>We strive to make you pet happy with low stress environment for your beloved pet. We give your pet breaks between the bath and groom, lots of healthy treats and affection before, during and after their groom and socialization with other pets to give them a positive experience when coming to the grooming salon. We do provide kennels for dog aggressive pets, or if you'd prefer your pet was kenneled rather than free roaming with other pets and are aware of pets with food sensitivities keeping several different treats on hand to suit each pet's dietary needs while still giving them little snacks to keep them happy.</p>
            <p>Above all, we wish to turn the shakes and shivers of a nervous pet in to wiggles and wags of a pet excited to come back to Puppy Bubbles.</p>
